This game/project will test your creativity to the limit.
These are called constrained games. In these games the player can move in only
one direction or can do only a very few set of actions. But the enemy is much more
variable/different.
If you think about it deeply it is like real life. You have only a few ways to move and
things that can stop you from all directions.
Your project is to create a game that will force the player only one type of
movement, with limited capabilities of fighting and the enemies can appear from
all directions.
ONE SUCH ExAMPLE COULD BE: https://divyaparmar18.github.io/bubble-shoot/

In this game the user can only move in one direction by pressing the side button.
He/She can shoot the balloons when it sees one in its LINE OF SITE.
Everytime a balloon touches your player you lose a little bit of your life. Every time
you burst a balloon you gain a life.
You can make your game even more interesting in different ways like Making new
types of bullets that will burst with a larger radius, or change the colour of the
screen when you burst a streak of bubbles.
You can also add a boolean to change the colour of your player whenever the
enemy touches your sprite.
Once you are done create a GitHub repository and share the link to your repository
on your student dashboard.
REMEMBER… Try your best, that’s more important than being correct.
After submitting your project your teacher will send you feedback on your work.
